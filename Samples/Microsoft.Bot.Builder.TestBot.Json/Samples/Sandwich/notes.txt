* DRuE vs. adaptive
** Missing
- There is no expected values to help prime
- There is no way to do generic rules that range over possible slots, default prompts
- Does not automatically use template to define what must be bound.  There is some question though how that would interact with more complicated templates, i.e. not all values are required.

** Improvements
- LG system
